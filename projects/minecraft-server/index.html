  <h1 class="title">Minecraft Server</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">2021-08-25</p>
  <p>When one of my friends suggested we do something nostalgic, I didn't expect that
they wanted to play <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft">Minecraft</a>. I was even more surprised when I found a
good place to run the server was in <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">Oracle Cloud</a>.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Of course with the Autumn weather starting early this year I think they had a
good point, so I had a go at setting one up. It was easy enough to follow along
an existing blog post on <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/post/how-to-set-up-and-run-a-really-powerful-free-minecraft-server-in-the-cloud#open-firewall-and-security-list-ports-to-allow-public-access">how to deploy a Minecraft: Java Edition server to
Oracle Cloud</a>, but I wanted to put my recent experience with <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>
to good use.</p>
<p>The result was <a href="https://github.com/chornsby/minecraft-server">a small Terraform project</a> which sets up the needed network
resources in Oracle cloud and then deploys and (mostly) provisions a Minecraft
server. I am particularly happy with the awful hack of restricting SSH access to
only the machine that ran the Terraform script.</p>
<p>Nice things to improve for the future would be using a proper firewall entry for
the server ports and a systemd service file to ensure that Minecraft is
automatically restarted in case of a crash.</p>
