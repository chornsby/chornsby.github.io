  <h1 class="title">Chip-8</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">2020-09-12</p>
  <p>The Internet recommends the Chip-8 as a first emulation target because of its
small instruction set, simple graphics and sound, and ease of getting something
working. I tried this using Rust for my first project that was larger than an
Advent of Code problem.</p>

<p><img src="/images/chip-8.png" alt="Chip-8 emulator showing the Cave program splash screen" /></p>
<p>I decided to try implementing the emulator without looking at other similar
projects to see if I could figure it out. I worked from <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM">Cowgod's Technical
Reference</a> which describes how the interpreter should work and lists the CPU
instruction set. I also used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">Wikipedia article</a> as a reference when
something didn't make sense.</p>
<p>It was very convenient being able to use Rust pattern matching to destructure
the 2-byte instructions and match against different parts of them: the most
significant bits determine the instruction type and the least significant
usually determine the registers to operate upon.</p>
<p>I also decided to go test first by writing the unit tests for the instructions
before implementing each one. Rust made this easy and pretty simple to run in CI
as a GitHub Action.</p>
<p>To begin with I wanted to use the recently released Bevy game engine for the
graphics and main loop, but this brought with it a lot more dependencies than I
really needed for this project. In the end I migrated my existing code to use
<a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL2</a> instead which was more lightweight and appropriate for this kind of
project.</p>
