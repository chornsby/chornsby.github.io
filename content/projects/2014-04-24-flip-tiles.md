title = "Flip Tiles"

This was one of the first recreational programming projects I attempted after
picking up JavaScript in 2014 using [Codecademy][0]. I wanted to make a simple
game using JavaScript and CSS without any image assets.

I recently updated the code to remove the dependency on [jQuery][1] â€” it felt
almost mandatory at that time. I'm happy to see the CSS animations still work
well-enough and that this is very much possible without any frameworks.

See if you can flip all the tiles so their green side faces up.

{{ flip_tiles() }}
