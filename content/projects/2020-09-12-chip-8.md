The Internet recommends the Chip-8 as a first emulation target because of its
small instruction set, simple graphics and sound, and ease of getting something
working. I tried this using Rust for my first project that was larger than an
Advent of Code problem.

I decided to try implementing the emulator without looking at other similar
projects to see if I could figure it out. I worked from [Cowgod's Technical
Reference][0] which describes how the interpreter should work and lists the CPU
instruction set. I also used the [Wikipedia article][1] as a reference when
something didn't make sense.

It was very convenient being able to use Rust pattern matching to destructure
the 2-byte instructions and match against different parts of them: the most
significant bits determine the instruction type and the least significant
usually determine the registers to operate upon.

I also decided to go test first by writing the unit tests for the instructions
before implementing each one. Rust made this easy and pretty simple to run in CI
as a GitHub Action.

To begin with I wanted to use the recently released Bevy game engine for the
graphics and main loop, but this brought with it a lot more dependencies than I
really needed for this project. In the end I migrated my existing code to use
[SDL2][2] instead which was more lightweight and appropriate for this kind of
project.

You can find the source code on [GitHub][3].
