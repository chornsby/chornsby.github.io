I am a Helsinki-based programmer currently open to software development
positions to build and scale backend services. I care about people, products,
and using automated testing to write clear maintainable code.

I have worked professionally with Python for seven years. I also have experience
with JavaScript and front-end frameworks like React but my strength lies mostly
in back-end technologies.

I contribute to open source and support the efforts of the
[Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/) organisation in their effort to
increase diversity in the technology industry.
