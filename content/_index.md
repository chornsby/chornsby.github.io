I am a Helsinki-based programmer currently working with Python and MongoDB to
build and scale the backend services powering popular music education app:
[Yousician](https://yousician.com/). I care about people, products, and using
automated testing to write clear maintainable code.

I have worked professionally with Python for five years. I also have some
experience with JavaScript and front-end frameworks like React but my strength
lies mostly in back-end technologies.

I contribute to open source and support the efforts of the
[Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/) organisation in their effort to
increase diversity in the technology industry.
